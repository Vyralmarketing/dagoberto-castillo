As you may know, mortgage interest rates are rising fast. The Federal Reserve has been increasing rates rapidly to combat inflation, and the higher they get, the more difficult it is to afford a home. If you’re looking to purchase a house in this tough environment, what can you do? Fortunately, there are plenty of mortgage options, and many of them are perfect for buyers struggling with rising rates. Here are some of your best choices:

1. **Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs).** With an ARM, you pay a discounted rate for a set amount of time. After this period, your interest rate can adjust based on a margin and index outlined in your loan’s paperwork. The discounts ARMs provide can be significant, especially since less than 10% of borrowers stay in their mortgages for more than seven years. You can even choose between ARMs with a fixed period that last for five, seven, or even up to 10 years. ARMs can be a fantastic option for those who only plan to stay in their homes for a few years, but they can be risky if you plan to settle down for a long time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
2. **Interest-only mortgages.** With this type of loan, you pay only interest for a set amount of time. Once this period is over, you’ll pay down the remaining interest and principal. The biggest benefit of these loans is that your initial payment will be much lower since you aren’t paying down your principal. However, these loans come with risks, so consult with your lender before you get one. That being said, these can be great for those with a steady income who want to free up cash for other expenses or investments.&nbsp;<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}<br>​​​​​
3. **Short-term mortgages.** About 80% of homebuyers opt for a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but that doesn’t mean it’s your only option. Shorter, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year mortgages come with several benefits: Your interest rate will be lower, you’ll pay less total interest over the life of the loan, you’ll accrue equity faster, and you’ll own your home sooner. The main drawback is that your monthly payment will be higher than a 30-year mortgage. However, this is a fantastic way to lower your rate and save money if you have the means.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
4. **A temporary rate buy-down.** With this, borrowers have the opportunity to lower their payments during the initial part of the loan. It can be a great option if you have a credit from the seller or know for a fact that your income will increase over the next few years.<br>​​​​​​

Each one of these options has pros and cons. If you would like to discuss which one may be right for you, please call or email. I'll always make time to take great care of you.
